# Assumptions and Limitations

This project intentionally uses proxy and synthetic data to demonstrate analytical thinking in the absence of proprietary brand data.



# Key Assumptions

- Grocery retail behavior can proxy lifestyle purchasing patterns

- Engagement and loyalty can be approximated using frequency and dwell signals

- CLV is modeled as a directional proxy, not a financial forecast



# Synthetic Data Usage

- Customer records were synthetically generated

- Metrics such as churn risk and loyalty score are engineered indicators

- Values represent relative differences, not absolute truth



# Limitations

- No real transaction-level fashion data

- No campaign-level attribution

- No true longitudinal customer history



# How This Would Scale with Real Data

With access to real Nicobar data, this framework would directly extend to:

- POS and CRM systems

- Campaign uplift modeling

- Lifecycle and cohort analysis

- Store-level personalization

The analytical structure is intentionally designed to be **data-source agnostic**.
