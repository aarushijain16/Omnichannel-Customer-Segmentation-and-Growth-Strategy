# Omnichannel-Customer-Segmentation-and-Growth-Strategy

# Overview
This project demonstrates how retail analytics frameworks can be adapted for premium lifestyle and design-led brands like Nicobar — without compromising brand identity, storytelling, or creativity.

Using Python and Power BI, I built an omnichannel customer insight framework that connects:

- Customer segmentation

- Engagement and loyalty behavior

- CLV (customer lifetime value) signals

- Product affinity and category intent

The goal was to show how data can support brand strategy, CRM personalization, and omnichannel experience design, not replace creative intuition.

# Business Problem

Lifestyle brands often excel at storytelling and aesthetics, but face challenges when scaling:

- Limited visibility into who their most valuable customers really are

- Difficulty balancing community-building vs. revenue growth

- Weak linkage between customer behavior and CRM strategy

- Over-reliance on discount-driven engagement

Key questions addressed:

- Who are the core, emerging, and at-risk customer segments?

- How do behaviors differ online vs. in-store?

- Which segments drive long-term value, not just short-term sales?

- How can loyalty be cultivated beyond discounts?

# Solution Approach

I designed a customer-centric, omnichannel analytics framework using retail data as a proxy sandbox.

**🔹 Customer Segmentation & Personas**

- Behavioral clustering using K-Means

- Segmentation based on spend, frequency, engagement, and channel mix

- Defined five customer personas:

- Engaged Regulars

- Transitional Shoppers

- Premium but At-Risk

- Occasional Premiums

- Price-Sensitive Shoppers

**🔹 Engagement, CLV & Loyalty Signals**

- CLV proxy modeling by cluster

- Loyalty and churn-risk indicators

- Engagement index based on visit patterns and interaction depth

**🔹 Channel & Experience Insights**

- Online vs. in-store behavior comparison

- Basket size, dwell time, and visit frequency analysis

- Identification of cross-channel optimization opportunities

**🔹 Product Affinity & Intent**

- Category co-purchase and affinity analysis

- Mapping product groupings to lifestyle intents (e.g., Hosting, Comfort Living)

- Insights to guide curated collections and personalization

**🔹 Strategic Reporting**

- Synthesized insights into a Power BI dashboard and strategy deck

- Designed for brand, CRM, and growth teams — not just analysts

# Key Business Insights and Strategic Impact

## *(Translated for lifestyle and D2C brand context)*

- High-value, low-frequency customers generated ~30% of revenue
 → Opportunity to design micro-collections and CRM nudges between major launches

- Loyalty correlated more with engagement frequency than spend
 → Shift focus from discounts to community-driven loyalty programs

- Occasional Premiums showed the highest CLV potential
 → Prioritize experiential retention (events, previews, storytelling)

- 25% customers identified as “At-Risk” but brand-aligned
 → Personalized reactivation without eroding brand equity

- Strong product affinity clusters emerged by intent
 → Curate collections and content by lifestyle moments, not categories

# Strategic Recommendations

- Build persona-led CRM journeys instead of generic campaigns

- Use engagement signals to identify brand loyalists early

- Design loyalty programs around access and experience, not price

- Align merchandising and storytelling with customer intent clusters

- Use dashboards for ongoing omnichannel monitoring

# Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

- Clustering & Modeling: K-Means, PCA

- Power BI

- Customer Analytics: Segmentation, CLV proxy, engagement scoring

- Data Engineering: Feature scaling, encoding, synthetic data generation

# Why this Matters for Your Brand

- This project shows how analytics can:

- Strengthen customer understanding without diluting brand identity

- Support CRM and personalization decisions

- Balance creativity with data-driven growth

- Build long-term loyalty, not just short-term conversions

The same framework can be adapted for:

- Lifestyle & design brands

- Premium D2C companies

- Omnichannel retail businesses

# 📌 Note

This project uses publicly available retail datasets and synthetically generated customer data to simulate omnichannel behavior. Insights are framed to reflect real-world lifestyle brand strategy.
